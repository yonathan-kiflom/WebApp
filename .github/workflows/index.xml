The most elegant design can fail if it forces users to conform to the design rather than working within the “blueprint” of how humans perceive and process the world around them.
This practical guide explains how you can apply key principles in psychology to build products and experiences that are more intuitive and human-centered.</description></item><item><title>Cards</title><link>https://lawsofux.com/cards/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lawsofux.com/cards/</guid><description>The UX Designer’s secret weapon The UX Designer’s secret weapon, brought to you by Laws of UX &amp;amp; Pip Decks.

Designers can use this knowledge to build more intuitive, human-centered products and experiences. Instead of forcing users to adapt to the design of a product or experience, we can use some key principles from psychology as a guide for designing in a way that is adapted to people.</description></item><item><title>UX Psychology: Google Search</title><link>https://lawsofux.com/articles/2020/ux-psychology-google-search/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Aug 2020 07:18:48 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://lawsofux.com/articles/2020/ux-psychology-google-search/</guid><description>A closer look at the ubiquitous search utility.</description></item><item><title>Peak-End Rule</title><link>https://lawsofux.com/articles/2020/peak-end-rule/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lawsofux.com/articles/2020/peak-end-rule/</guid><description>Why designers should pay close attention to the key peak moments during an experience.</description></item><item><title>The Psychology of Design</title><link>https://lawsofux.com/articles/2018/the-psychology-of-design/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lawsofux.com/articles/2018/the-psychology-of-design/</guid><description>A look at how designers can leverage psychology to build more intuitive, human-centered products and experiences.</description></item><item><title>Designing with Occam’s Razor</title><link>https://lawsofux.com/articles/2017/designing-with-occams-razor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lawsofux.com/articles/2017/designing-with-occams-razor/</guid><description>How a classic problem-solving principle can help improve our designs.</description></item><item><title>Design Principles for Reducing Cognitive Load</title><link>https://lawsofux.com/articles/2015/design-principles-for-reducing-cognitive-load/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lawsofux.com/articles/2015/design-principles-for-reducing-cognitive-load/</guid><description>A look at both the causes and ways to reduce extraneous mental processing for the user.</description></item><item><title>Aesthetic-Usability Effect</title><link>https://lawsofux.com/aesthetic-usability-effect/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lawsofux.com/aesthetic-usability-effect/</guid><description>Users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design that’s more usable. Takeaways An aesthetically pleasing design creates a positive response in people’s brains and leads them to believe the design actually works better. People are more tolerant of minor usability issues when the design of a product or service is aesthetically pleasing. Visually pleasing design can mask usability problems and prevent issues from being discovered during usability testing.</description></item><item><title>Doherty Threshold</title><link>https://lawsofux.com/doherty-threshold/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lawsofux.com/doherty-threshold/</guid><description>Productivity soars when a computer and its users interact at a pace (&amp;lt;400ms) that ensures that neither has to wait on the other. Takeaways Provide system feedback within 400 ms in order to keep users’ attention and increase productivity. Use perceived performance to improve response time and reduce the perception of waiting. Animation is one way to visually engage people while loading or processing is happening in the background.</description></item><item><title>Fitts’s Law</title><link>https://lawsofux.com/fittss-law/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lawsofux.com/fittss-law/</guid><description>The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target. Takeaways Touch targets should be large enough for users to accurately select them. Touch targets should have ample spacing between them. Touch targets should be placed in areas of an interface that allow them to be easily acquired. Origins In 1954, psychologist Paul Fitts, examining the human motor system, showed that the time required to move to a target depends on the distance to it, yet relates inversely to its size.</description></item><item><title>Goal-Gradient Effect</title><link>https://lawsofux.com/goal-gradient-effect/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lawsofux.com/goal-gradient-effect/</guid><description>The tendency to approach a goal increases with proximity to the goal. Takeaways The closer users are to completing a task, the faster they work towards reaching it. Providing artificial progress towards a goal will help to ensure users are more likely to have the motivation to complete that task. Provide a clear indication of progress in order to motivate users to complete tasks. Origins The goal-gradient hypothesis, originally proposed by the behaviorist Clark Hull in 1932, states that the tendency to approach a goal increases with proximity to the goal.</description></item><item><title>Hick’s Law</title><link>https://lawsofux.com/hicks-law/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lawsofux.com/hicks-law/</guid><description>The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices. Takeaways Minimize choices when response times are critical to decrease decision time. Break complex tasks into smaller steps in order to decrease cognitive load. Avoid overwhelming users by highlighting recommended options. Use progressive onboarding to minimize cognitive load for new users. Be careful not to simplify to the point of abstraction.</description></item><item><title>Jakob’s Law</title><link>https://lawsofux.com/jakobs-law/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lawsofux.com/jakobs-law/</guid><description>Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. Takeaways Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that appears similar. By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the users can focus on their tasks rather than on learning new models.</description></item><item><title>Law of Common Region</title><link>https://lawsofux.com/law-of-common-region/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lawsofux.com/law-of-common-region/</guid><description>Elements tend to be perceived into groups if they are sharing an area with a clearly defined boundary. Takeaways Common region creates a clear structure and helps users quickly and effectively understand the relationship between elements and sections. Adding a border around an element or group of elements is an easy way to create common region. Common region can also be created by defining a background behind an element or group of elements.</description></item><item><title>Law of Proximity</title><link>https://lawsofux.com/law-of-proximity/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lawsofux.com/law-of-proximity/</guid><description>Objects that are near, or proximate to each other, tend to be grouped together. Takeaways Proximity helps to establish a relationship with nearby objects. Elements in close proximity are perceived to share similar functionality or traits. Proximity helps users understand and organize information faster and more efficiently. Examples Google Search Results The spacing between each result on Google’s search results page contributes to the overall scannability of the page but also helps to effectively group each result as a related cluster of information.</description></item><item><title>Law of Prägnanz</title><link>https://lawsofux.com/law-of-pr%C3%A4gnanz/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lawsofux.com/law-of-pr%C3%A4gnanz/</guid><description>People will perceive and interpret ambiguous or complex images as the simplest form possible, because it is the interpretation that requires the least cognitive effort of us. Takeaways The human eye likes to find simplicity and order in complex shapes because it prevents us from becoming overwhelmed with information. Research confirms that people are better able to visually process and remember simple figures than complex figures. The human eye simplifies complex shapes by transforming them into a single, unified shape.</description></item><item><title>Law of Similarity</title><link>https://lawsofux.com/law-of-similarity/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lawsofux.com/law-of-similarity/</guid><description>The human eye tends to perceive similar elements in a design as a complete picture, shape, or group, even if those elements are separated. Takeaways Elements that are visually similar will be perceived as related. Color, shape, and size, orientation and movement can signal that elements belong to the same group and likely share a common meaning or functionality. Ensure that links and navigation systems are visually differentiated from normal text elements.</description></item><item><title>Law of Uniform Connectedness</title><link>https://lawsofux.com/law-of-uniform-connectedness/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lawsofux.com/law-of-uniform-connectedness/</guid><description>Elements that are visually connected are perceived as more related than elements with no connection. Takeaways Group functions of a similar nature so they are visually connected via colors, lines, frames, or other shapes. Alternately, you can use a tangible connecting reference (line, arrow, etc) from one element to the next to also create a visual connection. Use uniform connectedness to show context or to emphasize the relationship between similar items.</description></item><item><title>Miller’s Law</title><link>https://lawsofux.com/millers-law/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lawsofux.com/millers-law/</guid><description>The average person can only keep 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory. Takeaways Don’t use the “magical number seven” to justify unnecessary design limitations. Organize content into smaller chunks to help users process, understand, and memorize easily. Remember that short-term memory capacity will vary per individual, based on their prior knowledge and situational context. Examples Chunking Chunking can organize content to help users process, understand, and memorize easily.</description></item><item><title>Occam’s Razor</title><link>https://lawsofux.com/occams-razor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lawsofux.com/occams-razor/</guid><description>Among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected. Takeaways The best method for reducing complexity is to avoid it in the first place. Analyze each element and remove as many as possible, without compromising the overall function. Consider completion only when no additional items can be removed. Origins Occam&amp;rsquo;s razor (also Ockham&amp;rsquo;s razor; Latin: lex parsimoniae &amp;quot;law of parsimony&amp;quot;) is a problem-solving principle that, when presented with competing hypothetical answers to a problem, one should select the one that makes the fewest assumptions.</description></item><item><title>Pareto Principle</title><link>https://lawsofux.com/pareto-principle/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lawsofux.com/pareto-principle/</guid><description>The Pareto principle states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. Takeaways Inputs and outputs are often not evenly distributed. A large group may contain only a few meaningful contributors to the desired outcome. Focus the majority of effort on the areas that will bring the largest benefits to the most users. Origins Its origins stem back to Vilfredo Pareto, an economist who noticed 80% of Italy’s land was owned by 20% of the population.</description></item><item><title>Parkinson’s Law</title><link>https://lawsofux.com/parkinsons-law/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lawsofux.com/parkinsons-law/</guid><description>Any task will inflate until all of the available time is spent. Takeaways Limit the time it takes to complete a task to what users expect it’ll take. Reducing the actual duration to complete a task from the expected duration will improve the overall user experience. Leverage features such as autofill to save the user time when providing critical information within forms. This allows for quick completion of purchases, bookings and other such functions while preventing task inflation.</description></item><item><title>Peak-End Rule</title><link>https://lawsofux.com/peak-end-rule/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lawsofux.com/peak-end-rule/</guid><description>People judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak and at its end, rather than the total sum or average of every moment of the experience. Takeaways Pay close attention to the most intense points and the final moments (the “end”) of the user journey. Identify the moments when your product is most helpful, valuable, or entertaining and design to delight the end user.</description></item><item><title>Postel’s Law</title><link>https://lawsofux.com/postels-law/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lawsofux.com/postels-law/</guid><description>Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send. Takeaways Be empathetic to, flexible about, and tolerant of any of the various actions the user could take or any input they might provide. Anticipate virtually anything in terms of input, access, and capability while providing a reliable and accessible interface. The more we can anticipate and plan for in design, the more resilient the design will be.</description></item><item><title>Serial Position Effect</title><link>https://lawsofux.com/serial-position-effect/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lawsofux.com/serial-position-effect/</guid><description>Users have a propensity to best remember the first and last items in a series. Takeaways Placing the least important items in the middle of lists can be helpful because these items tend to be stored less frequently in long-term and working memory. Positioning key actions on the far left and right within elements such as navigation can increase memorization. Origins The serial position effect, a term coined by Herman Ebbinghaus, describes how the position of an item in a sequence affects recall accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Tesler’s Law</title><link>https://lawsofux.com/teslers-law/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lawsofux.com/teslers-law/</guid><description>Tesler&amp;rsquo;s Law, also known as The Law of Conservation of Complexity, states that for any system there is a certain amount of complexity which cannot be reduced. Takeaways All processes have a core of complexity that cannot be designed away and therefore must be assumed by either the system or the user. Ensure as much as possible of the burden is lifted from users by dealing with inherent complexity during design and development.</description></item><item><title>Von Restorff Effect</title><link>https://lawsofux.com/von-restorff-effect/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lawsofux.com/von-restorff-effect/</guid><description>The Von Restorff effect, also known as The Isolation Effect, predicts that when multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered. Takeaways Make important information or key actions visually distinctive. Use restraint when placing emphasis on visual elements to avoid them competing with one another and to ensure salient items don’t get mistakenly identified as ads. Don’t exclude those with a color vision deficiency or low vision by relying exclusively on color to communicate contrast.</description></item><item><title>Zeigarnik Effect</title><link>https://lawsofux.com/zeigarnik-effect/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lawsofux.com/zeigarnik-effect/</guid><description>People remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks. Takeaways Invite content discovery by providing clear signifiers of additional content. Providing artificial progress towards a goal will help to ensure users are more likely to have the motivation to complete that task. Provide a clear indication of progress in order to motivate users to complete tasks. Origins Bluma Wulfovna Zeigarnik (1900 – 1988) was a Soviet psychologist and psychiatrist, a member of the Berlin School of experimental psychology and Vygotsky Circle.</description></item></channel></rss>
